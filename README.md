{Fourth brain teaser} A malicious user who works in the darkweb uses a certain method to trick unsuspecting victims. He started by using three different tags by default. The first tag makes reference to the uniformity of links where we have multiple links ranging from 0-9 sent to one e-mail address. The other tags are focused on phone number and a text file. The content of the text file is this: " for God so oved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever beleives in him shall not perish but have evrlasting life".
